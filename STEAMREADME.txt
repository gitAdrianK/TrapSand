Differences between up and down
The block that is moving you down is uncapable of moving the player through solid blocks the way the upwards version can.
The camera updates while the player moves, but if the player is also inside another block the game itself kind of doesn't run the camera update.

[h2]Personal Notes[/h2]
If someone were to ask me for another block that moves the player but also needs to make sure the player cannot get stuck and is moved through other blocks I will decline.
