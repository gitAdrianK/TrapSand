# TrapSand

Adds the trap sand block that once touched swiftly carries you to the top unable to move.

Be aware that if the player touches the side of trap sand while also being on top of it the player will teleport instead of moving up, tried to fix it but its nothing but jank.
The camera updates while the player moves, but if the player is also inside another block the game itself kind of doesn't run the camera update, I tried, but I can't fix that either. Overall if someone were to ask me for another block that moves the player but also needs to make sure the player cannot get stuck and is moved through other blocks I will decline.
